## Open Match But Kube Got Shreked

[The original Open-Match repo is here, and has lots of examples and other code to dig through once you've taken a look here.](https://github.com/googleforgames/open-match)

OMBKGS is a fork of Google's Open-Match which focusses around getting the complexity out of the original Open-Match solution, and hacking the repository down to its essentials for local use and extension by curious parties.

Open-Match looks cool, but its reliance on GCP and Kubernetes means that it's sort of incomprehensible to look into for anyone using a less onerous workflow, such as your common-or-garden game developer.

To check this project out, you'll need Go and Docker installed.

Afterwards, all you (should) need to do is run 'make build-images' followed by 'docker compose up' to get the images spun up.
Finally, you can run the two programs in examples to watch a fake client generate Open Match tickets, and a fake director use the matches generated by Open-Match to get those fake tickets assigned to servers.
